# taskRecorder

This is an import from the taskRecorder module I developed in the context of the MACSI project. 
It is meant to be used with the iCub robot (reality and simulation).

It saves one/multiple trajectory files, where it stores the arms trajectories demonstrated by a user.
A port can be used to start/stop recording and change the trajectory file.

The module naturally works with taskRecorderGUI, a small window with buttons to start/stop the recording easily.
Once saved, the trajectories can be executed ("played") by the taskPlayer module.
